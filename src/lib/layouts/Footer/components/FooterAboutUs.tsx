        Hi, I'm Salahuddin Shaikh, the founder of an agency that helps small to
        medium-sized businesses go online by creating customized Software
        Systems using the latest technologies. What I do? I help people solve
        their business problems with software. I assist traditional offline
        businesses in transitioning online by developing customized Software
        Systems tailored to their needs. With over 5 years of experience in
        mobile app development, specializing in Flutter, I bring a wealth of
        expertise to every project. During my tenure at NeoSOFT Technologies
        until January 09, 2024, I led the development of the "Capital Bank of
        Jordan" app, overseeing its inception, architecture setup, and the
        creation of custom reusable widgets. Let’s understand what do I mean by
        a Software System, for example, you're a business owner who sells skin
        products and wants to take your business online through an E-commerce
        store. I'll help you build an end-user Mobile Application for Android
        and iOS, a Responsive Web Application for both mobile and desktop
        browsers, and an Admin Portal for managing these software solutions. The
        Admin Portal will include features like user tracking and management,
        review management, notifications, coupon code creation, a forced update
        toggle, a kill switch for emergency shutdowns, and much more. All
        applications will be secured with strong encryption techniques and
        algorithms. I’ll work with you on every step, understanding your
        problem, simplifying the problem, brainstorming on a solution,
        collecting your functional and non-functional requirements, collecting
        the digital assets required, understanding your pain points,
        understanding most important quality attributes all with in accordance
        to your budget.
