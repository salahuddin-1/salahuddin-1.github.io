          "I worked on the 'Capital Bank of Jordan' application on the Mobile App side, utilizing Flutter and employing Clean Architecture + MVVM as the project's framework. I laid the foundation for the app and developed various key features. My contribution to Capital Bank of Jordan focused solely on the frontend, accounting for approximately 70% of the app's widgets. I established the foundation for the app, designing and customizing every button, text field, and color for reusability. |Western Union: One of the most challenging modules in the Capital Bank of Jordan's app was the Western Union feature. It required the use of Data Structures and Design Patterns. A notable feature involved dynamically generating user input text fields based on API data. Each text field's details were dynamic, with no static elements. The module also involved making API calls based on user input and extracting data from dynamically generated text fields. ",

          "Project Goal: The problem that the butchers' dealers faced was the manual process of calculating transactions. Every time they went to the market, they had to jot down calculations manually in their notebooks. Then, upon returning home, they had to redo all the calculations using a calculator, transcribing everything into their notebooks. However, this manual method posed several risks, including the potential for theft, alteration, and damage of their notebooks. Moreover, the tedious task of maintaining and reconciling the records daily added to their workload. Some dealers attempted to use laptops as an alternative solution. However, this approach also had its drawbacks. While laptops offered the convenience of digital storage, there were concerns about data security and integrity. Storing data locally on a laptop made it susceptible to damage or loss, further complicating the dealers' efforts to streamline their record-keeping process.",
